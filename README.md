# Detection of Bone Fracture Using Image Processing in MATLAB
The bone fracture detection system is an image processing application where we can find the broken area of a bone using MATLAB. This is the process where user can input an X-ray image and after completing the procedure, it will display the fracture area. The idea is developed to help in medical science field. It can be used in orthopedics department to identify the actual fracture point smoothly which will help both the medical expert and patients to take the better decision for proper treatment. In this project we apply two techniques, Canny edge and Hough transform. Canny edge is better edge detection than other edge detection in image segmentation and Hough transform is used for detect regular lines and curves of the image.
